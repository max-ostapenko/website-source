## Overview

The Ad Experience Report provides information on the combination of site layout and behaviour, content, and ads that users are exposed to. It lists ad experiences that violate the Better Ads Standards, which have been determined to be highly annoying to users by the Coalition for Better Ads. The report includes a brief definition, the URL of the page where the ad experience was found, and images or videos if available. By fixing these ad experiences, website owners can increase visitors' enjoyment and the likelihood of their return, and improve the overall health of the online ecosystem.
