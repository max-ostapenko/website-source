If you are curious to learn a bit more about me - I'm a Ukrainian ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦, currently
live and work in Berlin ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª.

With Math, Economics and Entrepreneurship background I went into product
development in 2010. I think simplicity and structure are the foundation for
great experiences.

Outside of professional interests I love dinghy sailing, kayaking, cycling and
wild camping.
